        </header>
        <p>
          Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment that allows developers
          to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use
          outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment
          omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file
          system libraries.</p>

        <p>From a web server development perspective Node has a number of benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a
            good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).</li>
          <li>Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context
            shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design
            when compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.) Many other new and popular
            languages compile/convert into JavaScript so you can also use TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript,
            Scala, LiveScript, etc.</li>
          <li>The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has
            best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.</li>
          <li>Node.js is portable. It is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
            WebOS, and NonStop OS. Furthermore, it is well-supported by many web hosting providers, that often provide
            specific infrastructure and documentation for hosting Node sites.</li>
          <li>It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing
            to help.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can use Node.js to create a simple web server using the Node HTTP package.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_Node.js">
        <header>
          <h2>Hello Node.js</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The following example creates a web server that listens for any kind of HTTP request on the URL <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code>
          â€” when a request is received, the script will respond with the string: "Hello World". If you have already
          installed node, you can follow these steps to try out the example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Terminal (on Windows, open the command line utility)</li>
          <li>Create the folder where you want to save the program, for example, "test-node" and then enter it by
            entering the following command into your terminal: <br>
            <code>cd test-node</code></li>
          <li>Using your favorite text editor, create a file called "hello.js" and paste the following code into it:
            <br>
            <code>
              // Load HTTP module <br>
              var http = require("http");<br>

              // Create HTTP server and listen on port 8000 for requests <br>
              http.createServer(function (request, response) { <br>

              // Set the response HTTP header with HTTP status and Content type <br>
              response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}); <br>

              // Send the response body "Hello World" <br>
              response.end('Hello World\n'); <br>
              }).listen(8000);<br>

              // Print URL for accessing server<br>
              console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/');<br>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>Save the file in the folder you created above</li>
          <li>Go back to the terminal and type the following command: <br>
            <code>node "hello.js"</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Finally, navigate to <code>"http://localhost:8000"</code> in your web browser; you should see the text
          "Hello World" in the upper left of an otherwise empty web page.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Web_Frameworks">
        <header>
          <h2>Web Frameworks</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Other common web-development tasks are not directly supported by Node itself. If you want to add specific
          handling for different HTTP verbs (e.g. <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc.),
          separately handle requests at different URL paths ("routes"), serve static files, or use templates to
          dynamically create the response, then you will need to write the code yourself, or you can avoid reinventing
          the wheel and use a web framework!</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Introducing_Express">
        <header>
          <h2>Introducing Express</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular
          Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).</li>
          <li>Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.</li>
          <li>Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates
            that are used for rendering the response.</li>
          <li>Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Express itself is fairly minimalist, developers have created compatible middleware packages to address
          almost any web development problem. There are libraries to work with cookies, sessions, user logins, URL
          parameters, POST data, security headers, and many more. You can find a list of middleware packages maintained
          by the Express team at Express Middleware (along with a list of some popular 3rd party packages).</p>

          <h2>Where did Node and Express come from?</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Node was initially released, for Linux only, in 2009. The NPM package manager was released in 2010, and
          native Windows support was added in 2012. The current LTS release is Node v8.11.3 while the latest release is
          Node 10.7.0. This is a tiny snapshot of a rich history; delve into Wikipedia if you want to know more</p>

        <p>Express was initially released in November 2010 and is currently on version 4.16.3 of the API. You can check
          out the changelog for information about changes in the current release, and GitHub for more detailed
          historical release notes.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="How_popular_are_Node_and_Express?">
        <header>
          <h2>How popular are Node and Express?</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The popularity of a web framework is important because it is an indicator of whether it will continue to be
          maintained, and what resources are likely to be available in terms of documentation, add-on libraries, and
          technical support.</p>

        <p>There isn't any readily-available and definitive measurement of the popularity of server-side frameworks
          (although sites like Hot Frameworks attempt to assess popularity using mechanisms like counting the number of
          GitHub projects and StackOverflow questions for each platform). A better question is whether Node and Express
          are "popular enough" to avoid the problems of unpopular platforms. Are they continuing to evolve? Can you get
          help if you need it? Is there an opportunity for you to get paid work if you learn Express?</p>

        <p>Based on the number of high profile companies that use Express, the number of people contributing to the
          codebase, and the number of people providing both free and paid for support, then yes, Express is a popular
          framework!</p>
