      <p class=""><span>Vincent Willem van Gogh</span> (30 March 1853 ‚Äì 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
        Post-Impressionist painter
        who is among the
        most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100
        artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include
        landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic,
        impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37
        followed years of mental illness and poverty. </p>
